# Tetris

Classic Tetris on iOS. The game is developed based on my early years of playing Tetris and some information snatched from internet. This is not the perfect Tetris game by specification, so please bear with me Tetris fighters ;)

The project is open source, and is not meant to be put on App Store, so far as I know, individual developers are not allowed to do that with out right permissions from the "Tetris company". 

The motivation of this project is mainly to get my feet wet with SpriteKit and GameplayKit.
